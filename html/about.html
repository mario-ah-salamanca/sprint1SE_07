                How to Play
            </h1>
            <p class="standard-text">
                The beer game is based on supply chain and involves 4 players where each
                player represents one of the four stages in the chain i.e the retailer, the man-
                ufacturer, the wholesaler, the consumer.<br><br>
                Every week the retailer receives orders from the consumer without any time
                delay. The retailer fulfills as many unit of beer order as it can and then cal-
                culates the number of units that are required based on the total number of
                stocks left in the inventory, the cost of each beer, and the backlog.
                After some time delay, the retailer places an order to the wholesaler. The
                wholesaler tries to fulfill the demand of the retailer and estimates how much
                beer is needed. The wholesaler places an order to the distributor if he senses
                he is in need of more stocks. This process is repeated with the manufacturer
                as well.<br><br>
                Lastly, the manufacturer begins production according to the order demand.
                When the production is over, the beer is send backwards to the distributor,
                then from the distributor to the wholesaler, retailer, and finally to the con-
                sumer. There are time delays in each step during the downstream process,
                except between the retailer and consumer.
